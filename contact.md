  Interested in joining us ?

<p>
We are always happy to hear from **motivated Master’s students**, including those interested in summer internships or MSc thesis projects. If you are curious about our work and think the lab could be a good fit, please feel free to get in touch. Let us know what made you curious about our research!

For prospective **PhD students**, note that a “currently not recruiting” status on Miya’s IMPRS faculty page (https://www.phd.tuebingen.mpg.de/36499/Qiaowei-_Miya_-Pan) simply means the timing of the annual institute-wide recruitment round. It does **not** mean that the lab is closed to PhD recruitment. If you are interested in joining the group, please write directly to Miya with a brief description of your background, your motivation for joining the lab, and your research interests. You are also welcome to inquire about current or upcoming PhD opportunities and available projects.

For **postdoctoral candidates**, please contact us with a short description of your research interests, relevant experience, and how your work would connect to the lab’s research directions.
